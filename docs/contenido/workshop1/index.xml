Background # The &amp;ldquo;Primrose&amp;rsquo;s Field&amp;rdquo; optical illusion was created and designed by Akiyoshi Kitaoka, who was a professor of psychology in Ristumeikan University who dedicates his work to the study and dissemination of perception and optical illusions. Kitaoka&amp;rsquo;s best known illusion and one of the most popular illusions of the genre is &amp;ldquo;Rotsnake&amp;rdquo; which is based on the Fraser-Wilcox illusion and has been widely used (not always with permission) in publishing and advertising.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://computacion-visual-2022-2.github.io/vc_page/docs/contenido/workshop1/masking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://computacion-visual-2022-2.github.io/vc_page/docs/contenido/workshop1/masking/</guid><description>Visual masking # Convolution masks # Problem Statement # Implement an image processing web app supporting different image kernels and supporting:
Image histogram visualization. Different lightness (coloring brightness) tools. Background # Kernel # Convolution, Kernel or Mask is an image processing technique in which an odd-sized matrix is used to achieve effects such as sharpening, blurring or enhancement. These masks are achieved by convolution between a kernel and an image, changing the intensity of a pixel to reflect the intensities of the surrounding piexels.</description></item></channel></rss>
