## Problem Statement
Implement an image processing web app supporting different image kernels and supporting:
- Image histogram visualization.
- Different lightness (coloring brightness) tools.

## Background

A histogram is a graphical representation that displays how frequently various color values occur in an image. The histogram focuses only on the proportion of the colors and not the location of the colors in the Images. They show the statistical distribution of colors and the essential tones present in the image.


Saturation is the intensity of a hue from gray tone (no saturation) to pure, vivid color (high saturation). Brightness is the relative lightness or darkness of a particular color, from black (no brightness) to white (full brightness). Brightness is also called Lightness in some contexts, in particular in SQL queries.
